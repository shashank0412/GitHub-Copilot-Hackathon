# GitHub-Copilot-Hackathon
Microsoft GitHub Copilot Hackathon 


GitHub Copilot Problem Statement


The combination of Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing is taking the world by storm. To match up the fast pace requirements of the industry, new tools are emerging for the ease of development and understanding. Microsoft understands the needs of the hour and have developed Github Copilot. With the help of the Github Copilot, the developers can speedup their work with more accuracy and correctness and more available alternatives.

The hackathon is primarily focused on testing out the candidates on different themes leveraging the usage of the Github Copilot. There are five themes provided below and the candidates can choose to work on any of them. The preferred languages are mentioned along with the themes but the candidates are free to use the language of their choice: Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, .NET(C#)

Theme 1: Weather Forecasting Tool (Python)

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

Theme 2: Simple E-commerce Inventory Management System (Java)

Develop a simple inventory management system for an e-commerce platform using Java. The system should include basic functionalities such as adding, updating and removing products, and checking the available stock. Use GitHub Copilot to assist in generating code for implementing different operations and handling edge cases.

Theme 3: Personal Finance Tracker (JavaScript)

Create a web-based personal finance tracker using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions and display the current balance. Use GitHub Copilot to guide you in implementing features, handling user input, and designing a responsive user interface.

Theme 4: Task Management Application (.NET, C#)

Develop a basic task management application using C# and .NET Framework. The application should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Show how GitHub Copilot can be used to generate code for implementing CRUD operations, input validation, and user interface design.

Theme 5: URL Shortener Service (Ruby)

Build a simple URL shortener service using Ruby and the Sinatra web framework. The service should accept a long URL as input, generate a unique short URL and store the mapping in a suitable data structure. Demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for implementing the URL shortening algorithm, handling user input, and managing the data store.
